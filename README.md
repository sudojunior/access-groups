# access-groups

[![Action Status](https://github.com/sudojunior/access-groups)](https://github.com/sudojunior/access-groups/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)
![XO Code Style](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/XO/5ed9c7)
![Stargazers](https://badgen.net/github/stars/sudojunior/access-groups)

An action to help determine what groups a user belongs to.

**This action does not create any GitHub entities or modify repositories.**

> Future releases may include a fail-if clause, which would act as a fast fail for that step or job.

## Context

## Arguments

### User context override {Considering}

*May override specific features, preventing intended flow.*

```yaml
- uses: sudojunior/access-groups@main
  with:
    user: ${{ github.actor }} # as default
```

## Output

- `groups` is an array of access groups, as explained below.
- `highest-group` is the first element from `groups`.

### Explaination of `groups`

GitHub has a set of adaptive groups that exist under the hood to control permissions per repository and organization.

Groups for v1 are currently being limited to the following:

- `site admin` - Actor is a Site Admin for this instance
- `repo owner` - Actor is the owner of the current repository

It is worth noting that the data for the query to determine other groups is there, just not implemented yet.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: sudojunior/access-groups@main # or specific tag
```

## Future consideration

### User / Repo context override (via argument)

*Currenly open in [#22](https://github.com/sudojunior/access-groups/issues/22)*

```yaml
- uses: sudojunior/access-groups@main
  with:
    user: ${{ github.actor }} # as default
    repo: ${{ github.repository }} # as default
```
