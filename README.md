An action to help determine what groups a user belongs to.

**This action does not create any GitHub entities or modify repositories.**

> Future releases may include a fail-if clause, which would act as a fast fail for that step or job.

## Arguments

### User context override {Considering}

*May override specific features, preventing intended flow.*

```yaml
- uses: sudojunior/access-groups@main
  with:
    user: ${{ github.actor }} # as default
```

## Output

- `groups` is an array of access groups, as explained below.
- `highest-group` is the first element from `groups`.

### Explaination of `groups`

GitHub has a set of adaptive groups that exist under the hood to control permissions per repository and organization.

Groups for v1 are currently being limited to the following:

- `site admin` - Actor is a Site Admin for this instance
- `repo owner` - Actor is the owner of the current repository

It is worth noting that the data for the query to determine other groups is there, just not implemented yet.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: sudojunior/access-groups@main # or specific tag
```
